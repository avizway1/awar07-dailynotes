linux : Opensource OS designed based on Unix architecture.

linux torwalds

Open Source : Free to use, Free modify, free to distribute.. 
Security : Reobust security against malwares, viruses due to strong permissions and active community updates.
Servers, Databases and mission critical worklaods i.e; satilites..
Cost : No licensing fees
Cross-Platform : it can run on various hardware configurations.. embedded devices / supercomputers.. 

Linux Distributions:

general usage : ubuntu, fedora, linux mint, Debian
Enterprise : RHEL (redhat enterprise linux), SUSE linux, Oracle Linux
Community : CentOS, almaLinux
Penetration testing: kali linux, parrot os
Lightweight linux: alpine, bookwarm, Puppy linux, lubuntu

/ : root directory

Top level directlry, the parent of all other directory.. Everything starts here..
(Simialr to c:/)

/root : Root user's home directory.. Each user we create in Linux os, will get a home directory.. 
(Similar to C:\Users\Administraor)

/home : The home directory for regular users.. (non-root)
(Similar to C:\User\<avinash>/<test>)

/bin : Binary Executables :
Contains essential binary files used by all users (eg: ls, cp, mv)
comands in /bin are available in single-user mode and are critical system operations.

/boot: Boot loader files : Contains linux kernel, boot configurations and boot related files.

/dev : Device files : Contains files that represent hardware devices like hard disks. 
( /dev/sda, /dev/sdx)..
(Windows : Device manager)

/etc : Configuration files : Stores system wide configurations (i.e; /etc/passwd, /etc/resolv.conf)
** Contains imp system settings and service management

/usr : user Programs : Contains user level programs and libraries.
(windows: c:\Program Files)

/var : Variables Files : Contains data that changes freq.. (logs, database, webserver content)

/tmp : Temporary directory

/mnt : Mount points : Temp mount points..
/media : Removable media
/proc : process infroamtion : A virtual directory contains system informaiton i.e; RAM, CPU.. 
/opt : Optional Software : optional 3rd party softwre
lib/lib64 : Library files : (windows .dll).. contains essential shared libraries..

VIM has 2 modes:

Command Mode: used for navigation, deletion and other file operations i.e; line numadd

Package Management : 

RPM (Redhat package manager) : Outdated.. Installations, updates and removal of software packages on red-hat based systems.
--> It has a limitation, Does not resolve dependencies automatically.

install: rpm -ivh package.rpm
rpm -e package_name

--

YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified): Its wrapper to RPM, that can resolve dependencies and retrive packages automatically from repositories.

yum update
yum install <nginx/httpd/mariadb105>
yum search <package-name>
yum remove <package-name>

yum install tree				--> Interactive installation
yum install tree -y				--> Non-Interactive installation

sudo yum install tree -y		--> When working as non-root user i.e; ec2-user

---

DNF (Dandified YUM) : Modern package manager that replaced YUM in newer linux distributions. 
--> Faster dependency resolutions.
--> Plugin based architecture

sudo dnf update -y							--> Updates all the packages

sudo dnf install <package-name> -y			--> Installs the package using dnf


--> Sometimes, we may not find the required package in default repo available in our OS. We do have option to add service provider's repos. then we can continue with installation.
ref: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/redhat-rhel-fedora/


dnf search <package>
dnf info <packagename>
dnf remove <package> -y
dnf list installed

---

sudo dnf install httpd -y

systemctl status httpd				--> To check httpd service status
systemctl start httpd				--> To start httpd service
systemctl stop httpd				--> To stop the httpd service
systemctl restart httpd				--> To restart the httpd service

systemctl enable httpd				--> httpd service starts automatically after restart also.

ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT : Traffic not reaching ec2 instance
ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED : No service available to serve the request.

To serve your own content, Create files and place it under Documentroot path.

DocumentRootPath: http: /var/www/html/

Default httpd port: 80

httpd configuration path: /etc/httpd/conf/
File Name: httpd.conf

at Line number: 47, you can see LISTEN.. Modify it to desired port.

We need to restart the httpd package, as we perform conf changes. 

http://65.0.86.38:8080/


===========

zip songs.zip song1.mp3 song2.mp3 song3.mp3			--> Zip 3 songs into songs.zip file
zip songs.zip *										--> picks all files and added to zip

zip -r name.zip directoryname/						--> Zip an entire folder inc. subdirectories

unzip songs.zip

--

tar -cavf songs.tar.gz song1.mp3 song2.mp3 song3.mp3	--> create a zip folder with .tar.gz format
tar -xzvf songs.tar.gz									--> Unzip the directory

echo "hello" >> greeting.txt

=======

top : shows realtime view of running processes, system load, CPU and memory usage.
htop : shows top command output in better way. 

ps		--> Shows the snapshot of current processes

ps aux	--> Shows a detailed list opf processes from all users.

	a : shows process for all users
	u : shows user/owner of the process
	x : shows processes not attached to a terminal

ps aux | grep sleep			--> displays sleep related processes
ps aux | grep httpd
ps aux | grep sshd

kill <pid>					--> Sends a singal to terminal using process id. (signal 15 / SIGTERM)

kill -9 <pid>				--> Send SIGKILL (signal 9) which forcefully stops the process. 
**Use this option when "kill" is not working. 


We do have other command to identify the process IDs using name.. 

pidof httpd
pidof sleep

--> we can also use pkill command to kill the process using names.

pkill sleep


----

Checks free memory / RAM : free -h
check free Storage / disk : df -h

free -m		--> Shows memory in mb
free -s 5	--> run free command for every 5 seconds
watch -n 2 free -h

**htop gives clearner UI based live usage information.

----

Find a file by name

find / -name <file-name>

sudo find / -name greeting.txt

Make it case insensitive:	sudo find / -iname GReeting.txt

sudo find /home/ec2-user/ -iname GReeting.txt

sudo find . -iname GReeting.txt

--

Search file by file format

Find directories named "logs" in "/"..
sudo find / -type d -name logs

Find all the files which contains format .logs
sudo find / -type f -name "*.logs"

---

Install "mlocate" package for quick and easy search option. (latest feature)

sudo dnf install mlocate
sudo updatedb

locate filename.txt

---

Whenever you are working on multiple linux instances, You may need to copy some data from one machine to another instance. 

We can use "SCP" command.. THis works between linux instances only.. 
To transfer data from Windows to Linux Instance we can use "winscp" tool..

scp [option] source destination

---

From Local latop to Remote ec2 instance.. 

scp <filename> <username>@<instance-public-ip>:<path>

scp demo.txt ec2-user@13.201.3.223:/home/ec2-user/

TO pass the keypair 
scp -i <keypair.pem> demo.txt ec2-user@13.201.3.223:/home/ec2-user/

--

TO get a file from ec2 instance to local..

scp -i awar07-kp.pem ec2-user@13.201.3.223:/home/ec2-user/greeting.txt .

---

to transfer a folder using scp

scp -i awar07-kp.pem -r foldername ec2-user@13.201.3.223:/home/ec2-user/greeting.txt .
