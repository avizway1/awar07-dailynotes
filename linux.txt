Package Management : 

RPM (Redhat package manager) : Outdated.. Installations, updates and removal of software packages on red-hat based systems.
--> It has a limitation, Does not resolve dependencies automatically.

install: rpm -ivh package.rpm
rpm -e package_name

--

YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified): Its wrapper to RPM, that can resolve dependencies and retrive packages automatically from repositories.

yum update
yum install <nginx/httpd/mariadb105>
yum search <package-name>
yum remove <package-name>

yum install tree				--> Interactive installation
yum install tree -y				--> Non-Interactive installation

sudo yum install tree -y		--> When working as non-root user i.e; ec2-user

---

DNF (Dandified YUM) : Modern package manager that replaced YUM in newer linux distributions. 
--> Faster dependency resolutions.
--> Plugin based architecture

sudo dnf update -y							--> Updates all the packages

sudo dnf install <package-name> -y			--> Installs the package using dnf


--> Sometimes, we may not find the required package in default repo available in our OS. We do have option to add service provider's repos. then we can continue with installation.
ref: https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/redhat-rhel-fedora/


dnf search <package>
dnf info <packagename>
dnf remove <package> -y
dnf list installed

---

sudo dnf install httpd -y

systemctl status httpd				--> To check httpd service status
systemctl start httpd				--> To start httpd service
systemctl stop httpd				--> To stop the httpd service
systemctl restart httpd				--> To restart the httpd service

systemctl enable httpd				--> httpd service starts automatically after restart also.

ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT : Traffic not reaching ec2 instance
ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED : No service available to serve the request.

To serve your own content, Create files and place it under Documentroot path.

DocumentRootPath: http: /var/www/html/

Default httpd port: 80

httpd configuration path: /etc/httpd/conf/
File Name: httpd.conf

at Line number: 47, you can see LISTEN.. Modify it to desired port.

We need to restart the httpd package, as we perform conf changes. 

http://65.0.86.38:8080/


===========

zip songs.zip song1.mp3 song2.mp3 song3.mp3			--> Zip 3 songs into songs.zip file

ps aux | grep sshd

kill <pid>					--> Sends a singal to terminal using process id. (signal 15 / SIGTERM)

kill -9 <pid>				--> Send SIGKILL (signal 9) which forcefully stops the process. 
**Use this option when "kill" is not working. 


We do have other command to identify the process IDs using name.. 

pidof httpd
pidof sleep

--> we can also use pkill command to kill the process using names.

pkill sleep

find / -name <file-name>

sudo find / -name greeting.txt

Make it case insensitive:	sudo find / -iname GReeting.txt

sudo find /home/ec2-user/ -iname GReeting.txt

sudo find . -iname GReeting.txt

--

Search file by file format

Find directories named "logs" in "/"..
sudo find / -type d -name logs

Find all the files which contains format .logs
sudo find / -type f -name "*.logs"

---

Install "mlocate" package for quick and easy search option. (latest feature)

sudo dnf install mlocate
sudo updatedb

locate filename.txt

---

Whenever you are working on multiple linux instances, You may need to copy some data from one machine to another instance. 

We can use "SCP" command.. THis works between linux instances only.. 
To transfer data from Windows to Linux Instance we can use "winscp" tool..

scp [option] source destination

---

From Local latop to Remote ec2 instance.. 

scp <filename> <username>@<instance-public-ip>:<path>

scp demo.txt ec2-user@13.201.3.223:/home/ec2-user/

TO pass the keypair 
scp -i <keypair.pem> demo.txt ec2-user@13.201.3.223:/home/ec2-user/

--

TO get a file from ec2 instance to local..

scp -i awar07-kp.pem ec2-user@13.201.3.223:/home/ec2-user/greeting.txt .

---

to transfer a folder using scp

scp -i awar07-kp.pem -r foldername ec2-user@13.201.3.223:/home/ec2-user/greeting.txt .

=============

id	root					--> root always have id as 0
id ec2-user					--> ec2-user user id is 1000

sudo useradd avinash
id avinash					--> avinash user id is 1001

sudo passwd avinash			--> sets password for avinash user

su avinash					--> switch to avinash user


**Create a user without homedirectory.. Use below commands..
sudo adduser --no-create-home username
sudo useradd -M username
sudo useradd -r username


sudo groupadd developers	--> Creates a group named developers

sudo usermod -aG developers avinash		--> Adding avinash to developers group (secondary group for avinash)

sudo gpasswd -d avinash developers		--> Removes the user from group named developers

sudoers file location : /etc/sudoers

We have to use "visudo" command to edit

sudo usermod -aG wheel avinash			--> Adding avinash to wheel group, so, he can use "sudo" to gain admin level permissions..


Can i directly login as avinash user to this ec2 instance using avinash cred.

ssh avinash@43.205.178.165
avinash@43.205.178.165: Permission denied

sshd configuration path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config

sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

set passwordauthentication to yes

then Restart the service : sudo systemctl restart sshd
