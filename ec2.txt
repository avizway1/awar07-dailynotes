EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud : We cna launch and run servers.. 


EC2 is a region specific service..!! Chose a region and stick to it. : ap-south-1

Server : 

On-Prem server provisioning and configuration is time taking process.. in AWS ec2, we cna launch and connect to the server ver very clickly.. ==> Go Global in minutes
pay-as-you-go : Pay for the instance / server you use. (1 ht -> 1 hr bill)

$$$ --> Server 

Server = box = VM (Virtual Machine) = Instance = Azure VM = gcp compute engine

On-Demand ec2 instances : No contract.. Pay for the usage based on Hourly.. We have flexibility to test lot of configuragtions.. 


---

Reserved ec2 instance / RI : We can go with a contract with AWS for 1 yr period or 3 yrs period.. 

Standard RI : We cannot change the configuration during the commited period.. 
Convertable RI : We can change the configurations during the commited period.. 
Scheduled RI : For a period, for repeatative workload, we cna choose this type.. ( 1 year ==> Mon-fri / weekly 40 hrs)

Pricing options : 
Full Upfront : Pay full amount now and get the server.. 
Partial Upfront : Pay partial amount as one time (varies from 30-60%).. AWS reduses the instance hourly cost.. 
Based on usage, aws will cost us with redused hourly cost.. 
No Upfront : No need to pay anything.. pay everything on monthly basis only.. 

--> you can register as seller and sell your instance at lower cost at marketplace.

Instance Launch process : 

Step 1 : Allocate tags (name, project, cost center, os)

Step 2 : Choose an AMI (Operating System)

windows, Amazon linux, ubuntu, suse, fedora, debian, kali... 

Step 3 : Instance type (Pre-Configured CPU and Memory combinations)

t3.micro

Step 4 : Create a keypair and store it in a secured location (desktop --> keypair)


keypair --> Encryption and decryption with public and private key.. 

PublicKey --> AWS keeps it and locks the instance with public key
Privatekey --> it downloads automatically when we create a keypair.. If you wqant to connect to ec2 instance, you need to use this to unlock the publickey. 

Step 5 : network Settings

Firewall : Helps to filter the traffic.. 

Linux : SSH protocol (Secure Shell) : Port 22
Windows : RDP Protocol (Remote Desktop Protocol) : Port 3389
http : Port 80
https : Port 443

* Make sure you open SSH for Anywhere for today.. *Dont mention this in your interviews.

Step 6 : Storage ..

EBS : for Storage : Linux min 8 gb
