AWS DNS Servcie

DNS = Domain Naming System / Service..

Route53 = AWS DNS Service

A Record : Address Record : IP <--> Name (ipv4)
AAAA Record : Address Record : IP <--> Name (ipv6)
CNAME : Cananical Name : Another Name
TXT :  Simple Text Record : 
MX : Mail Serer Records..

Alias : THis helps us to pick the aws appropriote resources automatically.





We cannot delete these records..
NS : Name Server Record (THis helps to map AWS and Domain Registrer)
SOA : Start of Authority Record : 

DomainRegistrer : Godaddy, Bigrock, namecheaap, aws route53, hostinger
ICANN : Domain uniqueness
IANA root zonedb



Step 1 : Purchase a Domain name 

Step 2 : Create a HostedZone in R53 (Public)

Step 3 : Grab the NS records from HostedZOne and configure it at Doamin Registrer

AWS Route53 DNS has 2 types of resolvers, when we have hybrid-environments...


Inbound DNS Resolver : On-Prem to AWS : 
--> Allow on-premise systems to resolve private records inside the AWS VPC.

Flow: On-prem server trying to access AWS DB with DNS name..

On-Prem DNS server receives the query --> Forwards to Route53 "Inbound Endpoint" --> Route53 Hosted Zone --> verify the record --> Reach the Db server --> gets the response by On-prem server..


---

Onbound DNS Resolver : AWS --> On-Prem : 

Flow: AWS Server trying to access on-prem hosted DB with DNS name..

AWS Ec2 instance trying to access --> DNS HostedZone Resolver rule --> Forwards the traffic to "outbound endpoint" --> Req sends to on-rem DNS server --> reach the DB server...

----


http : HyperText Transfer Protocol : 
Port : 80 
Data is sent in Plain text
No Encryption
No Identity verification
MITM : Man In The Middle Attach : If someone intercepts the traffic they can read, Passwords, API Token, Form data, Credit Card.. 



https : Secure Over HTTP :
HTTP Over TLS (Transport Layer Security) 
Default Port: 443
Data Is encrypted
Server Identity Verified
Data Integrity verified

HTTPS uses: Symetric encryption, Digital Certificate, TLS handshake

ACM : Amazon Certificate Manager

We need to prove our ownership on the domain we are questing for SSL/TLS certificate.
