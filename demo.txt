IAM : Identity and access management : User Management
EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud : Servers
RDS : Relational Database Service : Database

Region : No technical definition for this region.. Its just a geographical location or physical location.. 
39 Geographic Regions as of jan, 2026...

Availability Zones / AZs : Data center or combination of multiple DataCenters.. Every region will have multiple AZs for HA purposes.. 123 Availability Zones as of jan, 2026...

Edge location / PoP (point of presence) : 750+ CloudFront POPs.. 

----

Root user: Account owner that performs tasks requiring unrestricted access.. 
AWS always receommend us to enable MFA for our root account.. 
We never ever use root credentials for day-to-day workload..


Least Privilages Mechanism : provide the only required permisisons to perform his job roles.. No less, no more permissions.. 


IAM Create : We can create multiple users in a single aws account.. We can allocate permissions based on candidate's job roles..

DBA : username & password :  provide "RDSFullAccess" permisisons.. 
NWAdmin : username & password : Provide "VPCFullAccess" permisisons.. 



Organisation : CEO --> (He can be part of any deprt. HR, Marketing, Development , Operation, House Keeping)

HR Deprt : 
Marketing : 
Dev : Can he recruit a candidate.? : No.. 


---- Birth Settings:

Action 1: AWS always receommend us to enable MFA for our root account

Action 2 : Setup account alias, this eases our login process..
https://aviz8.signin.aws.amazon.com/console

Action 3 : We need to setup account password polocies for entire AWS account.. 
Configure the password requirements for the IAM users.


Permissions : Comes from Polocies (Set of permissions)

AWS managed polocies			==> next Session
	--> Job Function
	--> Based on core service
Customer managed polocies

s3admin --> Enabled "management console" --> Permissions "S3FullAccess" --> Review and created.. 
Login and verified his access on resources.

AWS Defaultly follows "Implicit allow" mechanism : 

==============

D: 27/01/2026

In AWS, We have 2 types of accesses.. 
1. AWS Management console access : Browser, Username, Password and SigninURL
2. Programatic Access : CLI : AccesskeyID and SecretAccesskey


While cretaing user, we have to add permisisons to user. 

Add user to group : Create a group, add permisisons at group level, so that user gets the group level permisisons.. 

Copy permissions : We can copy/replicate existing user permissions by selecting that user. 

Attach policies directly : we can attach required polocies to an IAM user. 


Policy : Set of permisisons on our AWS environment. 

AWS managed Policy (based on AWS Services) : AWS provides these polocies, We cannot delete/modify these. Based on avaiable services in AWS, AWS will add/remove these. 

AWS managed - Job Fucntion Policy : AWS provides these polocies, We cannot delete/modify these. Based on avaiable job roles in current market, AWS provided tailermade polocies. You can see multiple services permisisons.. 

Customer Managed : Based on Customer's requirement, He can create required polocies. he has permisisons to modify/delete these. We can maintain versioning as well. 


Defualtly, we can add 10 aws managed polocies per user.
For an IAM user, we can add upto 20 polocies.


Example Scenario 1 : I need an IAM user, who has s3 and ec2 full permisisons and iam readonly.

Example Scenario 2 : I have an IAM user, who need all services access in AWS, But not on S3 Service.

Steps : Create a user and allocated Administratoraccess.. verified access inclusing s3 (able to access)
created a policy that can deny anything on s3 platform and allocated to the user.. This caused Explicit deny and s3 cannot be accessed by this user.


Service Name : S3
Effect : Allow / Deny 
Resource : limited to specific resources / all

4. Credentials report

6. How to add conditions to the IAM Policies.

D: 28/01/2026

Inline Policy : it embedded directly into one particular IAM user, group or role.
Inline policies can be atatched to only ONE identity (user/group/role)..
Whenever that identity deleted, the policy also deletes automatically.. 

When we use it: Whever any specific use required special permisisons, that we may not use again for other users.. 
--> We can use this to extend user permisisons whenever permissions limit reached.
--> ITs hard to track. 

Regular policies (AWS Managed / Job fucntion / Customer Managed) can be attached to multiple users. (Reusable).. 

---

Guardrail : Is a protective control that can prevent us from going beyond a safe limit, even if you try.. 

A permissions boundary is an advanced guardrail mechanism used to limit the maximum permissions for an IAM user/role. If if someone adds more permisisons, it wont take effect.. 

----

How to track an IAM user activity.?

Every single activity we perform in an AWS account, will be tracked and logged by "CLOUDTRAIL".. 
Enabled by defaultly in every single AWS account.. 
Defualtly it can store last 90 days activities.!! (We can store more --> s3, cloudwatch)

If you want to track any "global service" activities i.e; IAM, route53, Cloudfront.. You have to verify cloudtrail logs in "N virginia"

----

How to enable billing access to an IAM user.?

--> Login to your aws account as "root" user.. Then navigate to account settings.. Enable "IAM user and role access to Billing information"..

--> Create an IAM --> Admin / billing policies..

----

How to add conditions to the IAM Policies.?

IP Address condition: 

** 
https://checkip.amazonaws.com/

==================

D: 29/01/2026

Credentials Report : We can use this report for house keeping activities i.e; identifying and disabling users whoever not logged into aws account from last 90 days.. TO identify the users whoever not enabled MFA..

Access Analyzer : We can use this report to identify "unused" and "external/ Internal" shared resources..

External access findings: Identify resources shared with an external entity.
Internal access findings: Identify internal IAM users and roles that can access specific resources.
Unused access findings: Identify IAM users and roles with unused access.
